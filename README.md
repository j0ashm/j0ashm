<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

I'm Joash Mathew <sub><sup>(but I often go by the name <em>JustinOleski</em> online)</sup></sub></p>
I'm an avid tech enthusiast who loves playing with all things tech. I love experimenting with different technologies and frameworks to try and create "cool" things <em>(at times - not with a lot of success)</em>
I am originally from India 🇮🇳 but as of 2021, I am a first year Computing student at Queen's University, Canada. 🇨🇦

My latest pursuit for knowledge is in full-stack web development. I have been spending my days learning to work with a MERN stack.

To wrap up this introduction, here's some random facts about me:
- 🎮 I love playing open-world video games.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my first React website/project - [imitatio](https://github.com/JustinOleskii/imitatio)
- :octocat: I'm in the GitHub Campus Experts program as on **9th October 2021** 
- 👨‍💻 I have been managing communities since I was 14. Currently, I manage 3 communities totalling 1.5M+ members for [V&K Industries](https://vk-industries.com)
