<h1 align="center">Hi there ğŸ‘‹</h1>
<p align="center">I'm Joash Mathew<br><sub><sup>but I often go by the name <em>JustinOleski</em> online</sup></sub></p>

I'm an avid tech enthusiast who loves playing with all things tech. I love experimenting with different technologies and frameworks to try and create "cool" things <em>(at times - not with a lot of success)</em>
I'm a first year Computing student at Queen's University, Canada ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦, but I'm originally from India. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³
