<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

I'm Joash Mathew
I'm an avid tech enthusiast who loves playing with all things tech. I love experimenting with different technologies and frameworks to try and create "cool" things <em>(at times - not with a lot of success)</em>
I'm a second year CompSci student at Queen's University, Canada specializing in Security.

To wrap up this introduction, here's some random facts about me:
- 🎮 I love playing open-world video games.
- 🚩 I'm a GitHub Campus Expert
- 💡 I'm terrible at coming up with project ideas. Period.
